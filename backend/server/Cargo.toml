[features]
# Allow proxying requests to the SPA bundle through this server.
#
# Enables an additional CLI argument `--bundle-port` that allows specifying a local port where all
# requests for the frontend will be forwarded to. Websocket upgrade requests will be forwarded as
# well.
#
# This feature is primarily intended to allow hot reloading of the frontend during development.
# Accessing the hot reloading server directly breaks when the frontend tries to issue API requests
# using relative paths (such as `/api/repos`), as those would be forwarded to the hot reloading
# server as well. By proxying the request through this server, all relative links work as expected.
