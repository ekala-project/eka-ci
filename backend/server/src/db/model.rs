///
/// This type is useful if some fields of a model type are filled in automatically during insertion
/// and therefore require dummy values when constructing the type directly. These types can provide
/// a constructor function that returns `ForInsert<Self` which allows reusing the type definition
/// of `T` but does not allow the caller to access the inner `T`. The database routines however can
/// access the inner type and only use the known good values, letting the database fill in the rest
/// of the values automatically.
